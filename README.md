# Decision-Tree-CART
Decision tree implementation from scratch

- project folder structure :
  - DecisionTree - contains the implemntation of decision tree
  - Test  - contain the classification model build based on top of iris dataset (comparision with sklearn version of decision tree)
          - no parameter tunning is performed
  
Python version : v3.6
dependency : numpy v1.13.1
#### output

#### Future #todo task:
  - Analyse the reson for the performance deviation with sklearn(76 % accuracy) to 73 % accuracy.
  - implement tree purning technique to reduce overfitting
  - adapt tree for regression by creating differnt mechanism for creating terminal node
  - try cross entropy for evaluting the split
